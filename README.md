# Simple Multi-Agent Chat System  
### Knowledge Representation & Reasoning – Assignment 3

This project implements a minimal multi-agent chat system for the KRR course. It includes a **Coordinator**, **Research Agent**, **Analysis Agent**, and **Memory Agent**, along with a **Streamlit frontend** and a **console-based runner**.

The system demonstrates:

- Multi-agent collaboration  
- Task decomposition  
- Structured memory with vector search  
- Traceable agent communication  
- Console test scenarios  
- Interactive UI using Streamlit  
- Docker-based deployment  

---

## Features

- Coordinator handles user queries and routes subtasks to worker agents  
- Research Agent retrieves information from a mock knowledge base  
- Analysis Agent performs comparisons and produces explanations  
- Memory Agent stores synthesized findings and supports keyword + vector search  
- Full trace of agent actions for debugging and explanation  
- Five required scenarios executed through console runner  
- Streamlit-based UI for interactive use
